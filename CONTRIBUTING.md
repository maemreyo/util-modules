## üìê Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Avoid `any` type

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers
 * @param a - First number
 * @param b - Second number
 * @returns The sum of a and b
 */
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names: `my-component.ts`
- Use PascalCase for classes and types: `MyClass`
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `myFunction`

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```typescript
describe('add', () => {
  it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
    // Arrange
    const a = 5;
    const b = 3;
    
    // Act
    const result = add(a, b);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(8);
  });
});
```

## üéØ Development Tips

### Working with Monorepo

```bash
# Run command for specific package
pnpm --filter @matthew.ngo/storage <command>

# Run command for all packages
pnpm -r <command>

# Run commands in parallel
pnpm -r --parallel <command>
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
NX_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true pnpm build

# Debug tests
pnpm test:debug

# Use VS Code debugger
# Press F5 with a test file open
```

### Performance

- Use `pnpm nx affected` commands to only rebuild/test changed packages
- Enable build caching with Nx
- Use `pnpm nx graph` to visualize dependencies
